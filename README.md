# FlipperZero-JS-scripts

I have created these JavaScripts using ChatGPT for the most part, with minor manual modifications.

The method is based on jamisonderek flipper tutorials:

note: if you're trying similar method and ChatGPT gets stuck repeatedly troubleshooting a module, copy the module docs from the wiki (https://github.com/jamisonderek/flipper-zero-tutorials/wiki/JavaScript#capabilities) to chatgpt.

these scripts were only tested on momentum firmware
